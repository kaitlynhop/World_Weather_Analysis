# World Weather Analysis 

## Overview
### Current Weather
Using API requests of [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/), the current weather: maximum temperature, percent cloudiness, percent humidity, wind speed, and current description were determined for a list of cities generated with citipy script using random latitude and longitude values. The current weather was arranged as a dataframe in [Weather_Database](Weather_Database/Weather_Database.ipynb) and exported as csv file in [WeatherPy_Database.csv](Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv)

### Hotel Map
With data from the [WeatherPy_Database.csv file](Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv), an API requests of [Google Maps Places](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service) was used to create a map with markers denoting hotels for travel locations that matched user specified temperature ranges. The list of cities with weather stats and hotel name recommendations were arrangend as a dataframe in [Vacation_Search](Vacation_Search/Vacation_Search.ipynb) and exported as a csv file in [WeatherPy_vacation.csv](Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation.csv).
